<h1>Server Information</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The server was created by Tibia players, for Tibia players, in an attempt to recapture the nostalgic value of older versions of Tibia and war servers. Credits must be given to UmbyOTs which is a heavy inspiration. The software engineer behind this project is a professional Computer Scientist, completing their honours in a Bachelor of Computer Science (major in Software Engineering, minor in Physics), and as a side project began this.</p>
